## Day 2

### Quiz on Day 1 topics

- What is dependency injection?  Why dependency injection?
- What is the Spring boot starter to make your app a Web application?
- The **@SpringBootApplication** is a composite annotation.
  What is that made of?
- What is the difference between **mvn** and **mvnw**?

### Topics/Labs of Day 2

- Beans and Configuration (Just presentation only)
  - slides: pages of 66-99 of Spring_Boot_Slides.pdf
  - lab: page 5-8 of spring_boot_exercise_instructions.pdf

### Misc. questions

1. Is there a way to intercept bean creation process and inspect it?

You can implement your own BeanPostProcessor bean, which gets called after each bean gets created, as following:

```java
@Component
public class MyBeanPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor {

  private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass());

  @Nullable
  public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException {
      logger.info("---> before " + bean.getClass());
      return bean;
  }

  @Nullable
  public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException {
      logger.info("---> after");
      return bean;
  }
}
```

2. What are the pros and cons of the two schemes of defining Spring Beans?
   
- Using @Configuration and @Bean methods: Pros
  - Single logical location for Spring bean configuration, provides easier maintenance of bean configuration
  - You can define beans from 3rd party library classes you do not have source code
  - You can customize Bean properties inside the @Bean method

- Using @Configuration and @Bean methods: Cons
  - Extra coding 

- Using component-scanning annotated classes: Pros
  - Simple to use 
  - Existence of stereo types: @Controller, @Service, @Repository

- Using component-scanning annotated classes: Cons
  - Could pose maintenance problem for large apps
  - Cannot be used in 3rd party library classes without source code
  - Violation of simple responsibility principle

- Recommendation
  - Use "component-scanning annotated classes" scheme for use cases where the usage of stereo types make sense
  - Use "@Configuration and @Bean methods" for the rest of the app
  
## Day 3

### Quiz
